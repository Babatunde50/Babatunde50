## 📖 About Me

I'm a JavaScript full-stack developer currently based in Istanbul, Turkey . I'm passionate about building scalable distributed systems. I have experience working with Javascript/Typescript and most of it's relevant frameworks/libraries. I love contributing to open source projects and collaborating with other developers.
